This is a list of hardware, software, and general information needed to expand and better support various unique hardware and
software configurations for DiscImageChef. We accept donation of this hardware, or loans: paying for shipping is greatly appreciated,
but can make other arrangements depending on cost. For media, we do accept loans, but please be aware that due to itâ€™s age, there is
no guarantee it will still be working after it is returned and thus donations are preferred. 

Drives
======
This is a list of drives. The reason we need these drives is because it is the only way to add enhanced support for them (e.g. media
detection, ECC support, raw dumping, etc.). Also some drives depart from the specifications and need special workarounds. If a drive is
listed here, but the media it uses is not listed below, we already have media for it. Drives are preferred in ATA/ATAPI, SCSI, USB or
FireWire buses. Parallel port drives require a larger amount of work, and there is no guarantee it can work, at all, with other drives. If in
doubt, please contact us.
