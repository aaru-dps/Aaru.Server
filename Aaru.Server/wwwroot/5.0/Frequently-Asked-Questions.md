# Why the name, why Aaru?
Aaru is the Ancient Egyptian concept of paradise where your soul would be rebirthed after the preservation of your physical body. That's why we chose this name, because of the paradise where data will reside after it's has been preserved from its original physical media.

# Which operating systems does Aaru work under?
Any operating system with a .NET Core 2.0 runtime should work. Has been tested under Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and FreeBSD.

# Will you support media dump image format XXXX?
If you can send me documentation, test images and/or the application that creates them, I will do my best to.

# Will you create a graphical interface for Aaru?
After all features are implemented (analyze, dump, browse), I will.

# Can I use any of your modules?
As long as you comply with the LGPL license, yes. I would thank you if you tell me where you're using them.

# Can I use the CICM XML metadata sidecar format in my project?
Of course, I invite you to use it extensively and provide me with as much feedback as you can.

# I have tried Aaru and found a bug, how can I tell you?
Please don't send me an email, it will simply fall in oblivion. Github has a pretty nice bug tracker, just click [Issues](https://github.com/aaru-dps/Aaru/issues) and create a New Issue, that way the bug will not be forgotten and you can follow progress on its solution.
